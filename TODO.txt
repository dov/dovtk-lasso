** Idea for picking *DONE!*
   - When having drawn an overlay picture, it is may have several hot zones that may be moved. This is known as "picking".
   
E.g. for a caliper

      label = get_label_for_pixel(handler, x, y);
      if (label == 1)
        turn on moving of x0,y0
      if (label == 2)
        turn on moving of x1,y1
      if (label == 3)
        turn on moving of x0,y0,x1,y1
        
  - The label image is calculated on demand by creating a cropping context
    and calling the Lasso Drawing callback.
  - The lasso drawing callback uses functions set_color_by_label(). By default the label uses a A8 surface.

** Ideas
   - Exposure rectangles are known as *exprects*.
   - New routine ~add_exprects_from_draw~. These will be discarded during the next ~update()~.
   - new routine ~clear_exprects~.
